* add two msgs:
(a) getYourSucc
(b) getMySucc --- indeed the join_req msg
//tips: this was to realize common func in separate message, like chord's implementation of "find successor"


[90%]* implementation of send() and receive()

* implement service exposed to the upper layer
* implement on_receive_route


* read in "while(1) {read()}" is proved to be non blocking, why?
